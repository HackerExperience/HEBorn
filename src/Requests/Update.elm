{-| makeRequest is the function to actually send a message (internally Elm
won't send it right away, but that's an implementation detail).

makeRequest expects three important things: model, requestData and component.
`model` is needed because it contains UUID information (seed, etc). `component`
allow us to identify which component is sending this request (useful when the
response comes from the server) and requestData contains the request data:
its type (one of `Requests.Models.Request`), payload (one of
`Requests.Models.RequestPayload`) and decoder (which tell us how the server
response should be handled)

Before sending the message, a `RequestStore` is created, which contains data we
need to correctly route the response to the component (the 3-tuple
`(Component, Request, Decoder)`. The RequestStore is identified by the request UUID,
which the server will sent with the response (on the key "request_id").

{-| queueRequest is the function a module should call to let Elm know we want
to make a request. It's stateless since it will only emit an internal elm
message. The actual request will be sent once makeRequest is called.
This function expects a Request containing a NewRequest inside it. Since each
component has its own Request type, we cant create a single type hinting that
matches everyone, hence the `a -> Cmd a`.
